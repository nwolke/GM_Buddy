# [[Availability]]
This should be available as much as possible. 

# [[Reliability]]
Errors within the system should be little to no issue. However, response times should be high and issues tracked accordingly.

# [[Maintainability]]
The ease of the code should be using a proper design pattern that allows extensibility. With multiple game systems (based on SRD documents when available), the pattern should allow easily adding new systems
Avoid complexities however when appropriate

# [[Scalability]]
This is of lower importance. I don't expect it to take off in any significant way. I'd be surprised if anyone uses it often. Focus on 10 users a day. 300 a month.

# Consistency
This can be eventual consistency. Any actions are not required to be immediately responsive. Updates to data can be 2-3 seconds late

# Data storage
